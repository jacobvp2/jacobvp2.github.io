### About me:


I am a freshman majoring in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This is my first year coding ever and I am proficient in Java. I recently created a program that converts measurements in length, speed, and mass for those who do not like dimensional analysis by hand! Check it out on my github!
